# Nuclei-Image-Segmentation-Using-U-Net-Architecture
In clinical practice and scientific study, the segmentation of cell nuclei from histopathological images has been a major area of concentration for more than 50 years. Cell counting, movement monitoring, and morphological research including feature extraction and categorization all depend on automated nucleus segmentation. This provides important new information about the characteristics and capabilities of cells, leading to the early detection of diseases including breast cancer and brain tumours. Despite significant advancements in automated segmentation, it is still difficult to quickly and accurately separate a large group of nuclei and define their boundaries. Due to noise, unequal stain absorption, various cell types, and other factors, under/over-segmentations can occur in the presence of densely crowded nuclei. Our goal is to perform nuclei segmentation using U-Net Architecture.
